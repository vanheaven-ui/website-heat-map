# website-heat-map
In this project, we broke apart the website for a popular design magazine with which most are probably familiar by now ‚Äì Smashing Magazine. The goal for this exercise is to start training yourself to think in terms of visual hierarchy, typography and design principles.

Your job is to create a grayscale heat map of the website that indicates which elements have the greatest weight in the visual hierarchy. For inspiration, check out this image from vanseodesign.com which compares a site layout with no differentiation on the left to one with a thoughtful hierarchy on the right. Your final product will look much like the site on the right.

This is also an opportunity to get better at positioning <div> elements without worrying too much about what‚Äôs inside them, which will serve you well later.

Here's the old version website https://web.archive.org/web/20140301004610/http://www.apple.com/
