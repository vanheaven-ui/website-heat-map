# website-heat-map
In this project, we broke apart the website for a popular design magazine with which most are probably familiar with now ‚Äì Smashing Magazine. The goal for this exercise was to start training yourself to think in terms of visual hierarchy, typography and design principles.

Our job was to create a grayscale heat map of the website that indicates which elements have the greatest weight in the visual hierarchy. 


 For inspiration, we checked out this image from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170628134444/http://www.vanseodesign.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/visual-hierarchy-compared.png">vanseodesign.com</a>  which compares a site layout with no differentiation on the left to one with a thoughtful hierarchy on the right. 


Here's the screenshot of our work

Here's a <a href="https://raw.githack.com/vanheaven-ui/website-heat-map/home-page/index.html">live link</a>

Here is how the page was structured:
The page is divided into three main sections as below;
- the header section which encloses the navigation. Navigation was achieved by using unordered list.
- the main section which comprises of six sections that wrap the articles and the side bars.
- the footer section
