# website-heat-map
In this project, we broke apart the website for a popular design magazine – Smashing Magazine. The goal for this exercise was to incorporate visual hierarchy, typography and design principles to create a gray scale heat map for the website home page.

The grayscale heat map of the website was intended to indicate which elements have the greatest weight in the visual hierarchy. 

Here's the link to the original page: https://www.smashingmagazine.com/

Here's a <a href="https://raw.githack.com/vanheaven-ui/website-heat-map/home-page/index.html">live link</a>

Here is how the page was structured:
The page is divided into three main sections as below;
- the header section which encloses the navigation. Navigation was achieved by using unordered list.
- the main section which comprises of six sections that wrap the articles and the side bars.
- the footer section
